Folders are for files used to generate previously made (has a corresponding paper published) models from scratch with moderate changes.  This is so we can compare our model with competiting models and/or be able to take positive aspects of each one and implement into our own.  The exception is the m6Predict folder which is our initial attempt at creating our own model but is now disregarded.

Each model's creation consists of source functions, a processing data step, a training model step, and a testing model step.  Most include each step on a seperate script.  

The 4 notebooks in the home directory produce the most up to date version of our model with the highest accuracy thus far.  The source functions and processing step are unique but the training and testing steps scripts are the same as those created for the WHISTLE recreation (folder provided).
